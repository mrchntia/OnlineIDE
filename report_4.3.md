## Final Report (Group 4.3)

We assigned every team member to some requirements (see below). During the semester we had regular meetings to discuss our progress and debug the code. We have all worked together to fix our bugs. We also tried to participate in all the project tutorial sessions.

Originally we were a group of five, but unfortunately we couldn't reach Oksana Wannick anymore at some point. Claudius then told us that she doesn't want to continue the project.
